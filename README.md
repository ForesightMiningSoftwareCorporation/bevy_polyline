## About

Bevy Polyline is a plugin for [Bevy Engine](https://bevyengine.org/) that adds instanced rendering of `Polyline`s. The plugin comes courtesy of Foresight Mining Software Corporation who sponsor its creation and maintenance. Special thanks to [mtsr](https://github.com/mtsr) for the initial implementation of this plugin.

### Implementation

Bevy Polyline closely mimics the way `Mesh`es are rendered in Bevy. It works internally by passing a minimal Instance Buffer to the GPU, containing only the line segment endpoints and then completely determines all vertex positions within the vertex shader, such that the triangles form a line that is rotated around it's longitudinal axis to face towards the camera. The shader code is based on [this great tutorial by Rye Terrell](https://wwwtyro.net/2019/11/18/instanced-lines.html).

## Usage

See the `minimal` example for basic usage.

### Transform

`Polyline`s respect positioning through `GlobalTransform`, so you can position them directly, or through the use of a `Transform` hierarchy.

### PolylineMaterial

Currently the main way of customizing a `Polyline` is by changing the `PolylineMaterial`, which, as can be seen above, has fields for `width`, `color` and `perspective`. `width` directly correlates to screen pixels in non-perspective mode. In `perspective` mode `width` gets divided by the w component of the homogeneous coordinate, meaning it corresponds to screen pixels at the near plane and becomes progressively smaller further away.

### Aliasing/shimmering

Bevy Polyline does some work to reduce aliasing, by implementing the line thinness fade from <https://acegikmo.com/shapes/docs/#anti-aliasing>. But if your line segments are very short, you will still see shimmering, caused by triangles < 1 pixel in size. This can be reduced by only adding segments of a minimum length.

### Performance

Due to instancing, Bevy Polyline only makes one drawcall per `PolyLine`, one for the line segments ~~and one for the miter joins~~ (not currently enabled). We've tested the `nbody` demo at some 500 lines with 4096 segments being updated every frame (in addition to a 4th order Yoshida integrator for the nbody simulation) running at 60fps. There is still some room for performance optimization, particularly reducing to one drawcall per `Polyline` (depending on join and cap types) and more efficient updates of the instance buffer for updated lines.

## Bevy Version Support

We intend to track the `main` branch of Bevy. PRs supporting this are welcome!
